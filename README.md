## üìò Project Overview
The **AI Job Market Insights** project analyzes current AI job trends and predicts **job growth projections** for various AI-related roles.  
The goal is to help professionals, recruiters, and companies understand **which AI skill sets and positions** are most likely to grow in the near future.

This end-to-end project demonstrates skills in:
- Data preprocessing and encoding  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Model evaluation and feature importance visualization

## üìÇ Dataset Description

**Dataset Name:** `ai_job_market_insights.csv`

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Salary` | Average salary for AI roles (numeric) |
| `Experience_Required` | Required years of experience |
| `Skill_Level` | Skill proficiency (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert) |
| `Company_Size` | Size of company (Small / Medium / Large) |
| `Job_Type` | Job category (e.g., Data Scientist, ML Engineer, AI Analyst) |
| `Location` | Job location (City/Region) |
| `Job_Growth_Projection` | Target variable ‚Äî job growth trend (0 = Low, 1 = Medium, 2 = High) |

> üîπ Only `Salary` is numeric; all others are categorical.  
> üîπ The target variable (`Job_Growth_Projection`) is multiclass.

## üß© Project Workflow

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Checked and handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical features using **OneHotEncoder**  
- Scaled numeric features where needed  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Visualized distributions and job trends  
- Analyzed correlation between `Salary` and target variable  
- Checked target class balance  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development**
Models applied:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

Techniques used:
- `Pipeline()` for preprocessing and modeling  
- `GridSearchCV()` for hyperparameter tuning  
- `StratifiedKFold()` for balanced cross-validation  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation**
Metrics used:
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.36 |
| Random Forest | 0.35 |
| XGBoost | 0.41 ‚úÖ |

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance**
- Extracted feature importance from XGBoost  
- Visualized top 20 influential features using Seaborn bar plots
